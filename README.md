### Demo
A demo of the game is available here: http://srcflux.com/pong

### DIsclaimer
This is just a prototype I made in a few hours. I have only tested it in Google Chrome, but it should work across all modern browsers.

Some areas definitely need improvement, but this should serve as a good starting point for writing your own Pong clone I guess.
